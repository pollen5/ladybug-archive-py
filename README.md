# LadyBug Bot
This is the v1 version of Ladybug Bot which was made in Python, today it is in Golang and has been renamed and this Python version is archived here for historical and educational purposes, feel free to take anything you want from this code.

**Note:** I won't help with the code or hosting it, it is old enough that it's behind breaking changes from the libraries used and may not run as is. This is just an archive.

Below is the original README:

A simple discord bot written in python.
